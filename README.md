# Python Mini Projects Repository  

Welcome to my collection of Python mini projects! These projects are designed to showcase the versatility of Python and its rich set of features. Each project demonstrates the use of key programming concepts, including:  

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Regular Expressions  
- Multithreading  
- Memory Management  
- Python Modules and Packages  
- File Handling  
- Core Python Basics  

This repository is a great starting point for beginners and a useful reference for experienced developers to understand Python's practical applications.  

## Projects Overview  

### 1. Guess the Number Game  
A simple yet engaging game where the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess it.  
- **Features:**  
  - Provides hints for higher or lower guesses.  
  - Implements random number generation and user input validation.  
- **Concepts Used:** Loops, conditionals, and Pythonâ€™s `random` module.  

### 2. Hangman  
The classic Hangman game where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word.  
- **Features:**  
  - Dynamic word selection from a file.  
  - Tracks incorrect guesses with a graphical representation of the hangman.  
- **Concepts Used:** String manipulation, file handling, and control flow.  

### 3. OTP Verification  
A secure and practical application for generating and verifying one-time passwords.  
- **Features:**  
  - OTP generation with user-defined length.  
  - Validates OTP format using regular expressions.  
- **Concepts Used:** Regular expressions, random number generation, and string formatting.  

### 4. Password Protection  
An application designed to manage passwords securely using encryption.  
- **Features:**  
  - Encrypts and decrypts passwords using secure algorithms.  
  - Stores and retrieves data from files securely.  
- **Concepts Used:** File handling, cryptography libraries, and memory-efficient coding practices.  

### 5. Library Management System  
A mini system to manage library operations such as book issuance, returns, and inventory tracking.  
- **Features:**
